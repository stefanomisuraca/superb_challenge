<h1>Superb Challenge</h1>

<h2>Considerations:</h2>
I did not have experience in creating APIs with NodeJS + EspressJs + MongoDB
All the code i wrote included study and breaking many walls.


<h3>How to install</h3>
The only requirement is Docker.
You can install docker from [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

After you install docker:
<ol>
<li>Clone the repository from [Github Repo](https://github.com/stefanomisuraca/superb_challenge)</li>
</ol>
